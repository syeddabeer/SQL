Q.
Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| Id          | int  |
| Salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.

approach 1 without reporting null:
SELECT DISTINCT SALARY AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY SALARY DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1

approach 2 for reporting null: MYSQL:
SELECT 
IFNULL (
(SELECT DISTINCT SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY SALARY DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1), NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary 



Q.
Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| Id          | int  |
| Salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write an SQL query to report the nth highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no nth highest salary, the query should report null.

The query result format is in the following example.


approach 2:
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
Set N = N-1;
RETURN (

SELECT 
IFNULL(
(SELECT DISTINCT SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY SALARY DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET N
), NULL) AS getNthHighestSalary

);
END


Q. SYNTAX OF FUNCTION?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
CREATE FUNCTION NAME(N, INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
SET N=N-1
RETURN (




);
END


Q. Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.
 

Table: Address

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table containts information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.
 

Write an SQL query to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a PersonId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----------+----------+-----------+
| PersonId | LastName | FirstName |
+----------+----------+-----------+
| 1        | Wang     | Allen     |
| 2        | Alice    | Bob       |
+----------+----------+-----------+
Address table:
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| AddressId | PersonId | City          | State      |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| 1         | 2        | New York City | New York   |
| 2         | 3        | Leetcode      | California |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| FirstName | LastName | City          | State    |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| Allen     | Wang     | Null          | Null     |
| Bob       | Alice    | New York City | New York |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
Explanation: 
There is no address in the address table for the PersonId = 1 so we return null in their city and state.
AddressId = 1 contains information about the address of PersonId = 2.

SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, a.City, a.State
FROM Person p LEFT OUTER JOIN Address a
ON p.PersonId=a.PersonId

SELECT emp.Name AS Employee
FROM Employee emp INNER JOIN Employee mgr
ON emp.ManagerId=mgr.Id
WHERE emp.Salary>mgr.Salary



Q. Table: Logs

| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.
Example 1:
Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |

| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

SELECT DISTINCT l1.Num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM logs l1, logs l2, logs l3
WHERE
l1.Id = l2.Id-1 AND
l2.Id = l3.Id-1 AND
l1.Num = l2.Num AND
l2.Num = l3.Num
